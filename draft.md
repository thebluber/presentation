In general, testing is a complex topic:
own discipline alongside with other software development techniques
in the industry, test engineer, test manager deal exclusively with software testing activities
focus for this presentation:
to answer 3 questions from a developer's point of view
#Why We should do Testing -> Testing in the Context of Software Quality
To answer this question, we have to take a brief look at the issue software quality.
almost All presentations we've seen sofar have somehow to do with quality improvement.
to improve quality means to maximize some of those characteristics.
- What does Software Quality mean?
  - Correctness, Usability, Performance, Cost, Maintainability, Testability
- Which role does testing have in software quality?
  - Testing activity as we developer know is stronly related to the debugging activity
  - Testing helps us to detect errors in programs
- Is it sufficient to ensure the quality?
  - Testing can not prove correctness
  - Testing is not efficient in finding bugs
#What Could We Do Wrong?
- Last minut testing -> turn out to be expensive
- Test what works:clean test vs dirty test -> influence of subjectivity in finding bugs
- Insufficient test coverage -> good feeling about test coverage doesn't mean adequate coverage
#How Should We Do It Right?
- Hope to find bugs
- Aim for better testcoverage
- Test as early as possible
- Test often and automatically
- Find bugs only once
- Analyze Testing results, record errors
